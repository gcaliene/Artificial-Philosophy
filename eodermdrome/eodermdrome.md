<blockquote>
An eodermdrome is a form of word play wherein a word (or phrase) is formed from a set of letters (or words) in such a way that it has a non-planar spelling net.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Eodermdrome contains only the letters e, o, d, r and m. When plotted as a graph, the lettered vertices are sequentially connected by edges to spell a word. If the graph is non-planar, the word is an eodermdrome. The graph of eodermdrome is the non-planar graph K₅. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eodermdrome">via</a>]
</blockquote>

The word ‘supersaturates’ is likewise an eodermdrome.

<blockquote>
The graph of the complete word contains a subgraph which is a subdivision of the non-planar graph K₃,₃, and as such is itself non-planar. (ibid.)

Nick Land's (2011: 636-38) diagrams of words from Deleuze & Guattari appear to be variations of eodermdromes.

### The Project:

Write a program to search a dictionary (or any other corpus) for eodermdromes.
<br>Optimally, the program should be able to display these graphically.

This project can be further extended to eodermdromic phrases or sentences. 
<br>It would be interesting to write a program to find eodermdromic phrases in any given corpus.
<br>Another idea is Oulipian short stories embodying interesting graph theoretic properties.
