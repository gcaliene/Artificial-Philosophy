The Chinese philosopher Gongsun Long (公孙龙) is famous for asserting absurd claims, such as "A white horse is not a horse" (白马非马) 
or "A chicken has three legs" (鸡三足), then giving elaborate sophistical arguments to prove their truth. 

Often, these revolve  around genuine logical issues, such as the abstract concept of 'leg' being seen as on the same plane as a chicken's 
two physical legs, adding up to three. In a similar fashion, a common reading of "A white horse is not a horse" is that Gongsun 
Long is playing on the equivocal meaning of 'is/isn't' (是/非) in Chinese.

The field of ‘Chinese logic’ formalizes arguments in classical Chinese philosophy. For famous problems such as
白马非马, many formalizations are available, with conflicting interpretations. For another sophism by Gongsun Long, entitled 
指物论 (<i>Discourse on Pointing and Things</i>), formalizing extant interpretations quickly shows them to be logically incoherent or trivial.

This project is part of computational metaphysics, which applies theorem proving software to philosophical arguments in order to spell out
their implicit premises. To my knowledge, no such research has yet been carried out for Chinese philosophy.
